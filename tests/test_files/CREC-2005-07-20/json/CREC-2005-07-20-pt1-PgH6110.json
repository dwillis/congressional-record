      "text": "  Mr. EMANUEL. Mr. Speaker, the first Vioxx lawsuit to reach trial is \ncurrently being played out in Texas. The case focuses on the needless \ndeath of Robert Ernst, a produce manager at Wal-Mart who also ran \nmarathons and worked as a personal trainer. He took Vioxx for 8 months \nbefore he died of an irregular heartbeat.\n  As the New York Times reports today, it turns out that Merck and \nother pharmaceutical companies may have knowingly misrepresented the \ndangers of its drug, Vioxx, to doctors and patients and the public as a \nwhole. Yet, while this trial is going on, this Congress is planning on \nprotecting the pharmaceutical industry from such lawsuits.\n  On the right side of the screen, a family is fighting an injustice. \nOn the left side of the screen, this Congress is mounting a rear-guard \naction to protect the pharmaceutical industry. If next week we plan on \nbringing up the medical malpractice legislation and have a blatantly \nbeneficial provision for the pharmaceutical industry and only the \npharmaceutical industry, I will introduce the Vioxx amendment to strip \nthe bill of this provision.\n",
