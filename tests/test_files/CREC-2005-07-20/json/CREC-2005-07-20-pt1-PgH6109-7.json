Mr. Speaker, the United States tracks cattle from where they \nare born as calves on ranches in Wyoming, Montana, and Texas to the \nslaughterhouses of the Midwest, to the butcher shops of the Northeast, \nto our supper tables where they end up as steaks. We have even tracked \na mad cow born in Canada 3 years ago to some remote barn in Washington. \nWe have not only tracked this mad cow, but all her calves in their \ndifferent locations in the United States.\n  Mr. Speaker, we know where the cattle are, but why is it that we can \ntrack one mad cow but the Federal Government cannot seem to locate 10 \nto 14 million illegal people living in the United States, people who \nhave invaded our land and disrespected our rule of\n\n\nlaw. Someone has suggested that we give all people illegally coming \nacross our borders a cow, and then let the Agricultural Department keep \nup with them and do the job the immigration people refuse to do.\n  Our Federal Government needs to be just as concerned about the \nillegal people coming into the United States as we are about some sick \ncow coming from Canada.\n  Mr. Speaker, this ought not to be.\n",
