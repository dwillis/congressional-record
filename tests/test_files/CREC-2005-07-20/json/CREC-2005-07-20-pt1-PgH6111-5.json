U.S. economic prosperity \nis closely tied to the availability of a reliable and affordable supply \nof energy. As the economy grows, so will the demand for energy. \nAccording to the Energy Information Agency, the United States, by the \nyear 2025, is expected to need 44 percent more petroleum, 38 percent \nmore natural gas, 43 percent more coal, 54 percent more electricity, \nand 54 percent more renewable energy.\n  Record increases in the prices at the pump and in overall energy cost \nunderscore the long-term need to enact a comprehensive national energy \nstrategy. So, Mr. Speaker, the time is now to do so.\n",
