We have seen a very long and \ngrowing list of individuals here in the House, Democrats and \nRepublicans, and organizations as well, U.S. businesses, large and \nsmall, conservatives and liberals, academia, foreign policy experts and \nprominent Central Americans.\n  But sometimes it is more telling to look at the opponents of a \nparticular measure. One of the fiercest opponents of DR-CAFTA is Daniel \nOrtega, the former Nicaraguan Communist dictator responsible for years \nof violence and oppression. Today he is trying, as he has been for \nyears, to stage a comeback. He is banking a great deal on the effort to \ndefeat DR-CAFTA. Daniel Ortega knows full well that the economic \nopportunities that DR-CAFTA will bring would improve the quality of \nlife for Nicaraguans, fight corruption through greater transparency, \nand solidify Nicaragua's commitment to economic and political freedom. \nFor a dictator whose support stems from civil unrest and ability to \nmanipulate Nicaragua's judicial and legislative systems, implementation \nof DR-CAFTA would be extremely bad news. I urge my colleagues to oppose \nthe Ortega agenda and support DR-CAFTA.\n",
