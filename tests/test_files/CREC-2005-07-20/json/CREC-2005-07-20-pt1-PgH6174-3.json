      "text": "  Mr. LEWIS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight in support of the \nU.S.-Dominican Republic-Central American Free Trade Agreement. This \nagreement will ensure America's competitiveness in Central America and \nthroughout the world, benefiting millions of American farmers, \nmanufacturers and businesses of all sizes.\n  The CAFTA region currently imports $15 billion annually of U.S. \nagriculture and manufactured goods. Combined, DR-CAFTA countries \nrepresent our thirteenth largest export market. DR-CAFTA will \nsignificantly increase exports and boost earnings for American farmers \nand manufacturers. Upon enactment, 80 percent of U.S. industrial \nconsumer products will immediately become duty-free, leveling the \nplaying field for U.S. producers who have long been at a competitive \ndisadvantage with other countries with pre-existing trade agreements in \nthe region.\n  The proposed agreement will also take important new steps to protect \nU.S. firms from unfair trading practices and elevate standards for \nworkplace safety and environmental responsibility. DR-CAFTA legislation \nwill also take important new steps to protect U.S. firms from unfair \ntrading practices and elevate standards for workplace safety and \nenvironmental responsibility. DR-CAFTA legislation will be a catalyst \nfor positive change in Central America, broadly opening new markets, \nsupporting stability, and propelling emerging economies forward.\n  As history has proven, politically and economically stable neighbor \nnations are vital to our own national security interests.\n",
