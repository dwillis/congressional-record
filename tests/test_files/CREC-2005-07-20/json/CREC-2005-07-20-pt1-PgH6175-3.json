Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues for letting me \nfollow the Top Gun, the gentleman from California (Mr. Cunningham), in \ngiving our thoughts about Admiral Stockdale because Admiral Stockdale \nrepresented the very finest in American heroism. When he was going to \nbe pulled in by the North Vietnamese to do a propaganda film he beat \nhimself in the face with a stool that was in his little prison cell so \nthat they could not use him.\n  He shared for a while a prison cell with another great friend of \nours, Sam Johnson, who was one of our wonderful POW heroes and is such \na hero in this Chamber.\n  I want to thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Cunningham) for \nhis great service, as a guy who flew into a pack of 28 MiGs to save his \nwing man and was nominated for the Congressional Medal of Honor and \nreceived the Navy Cross because he was cut out of the same cloth as \nthat great Admiral Stockdale.\n  Our very best to the Stockdale family, to Sybil and the kids, and to \nevery aviator who would follow that tradition of heroism and continue \nto keep our country safe.\n",
