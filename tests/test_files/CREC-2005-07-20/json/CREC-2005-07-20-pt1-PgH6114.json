      "text": "  Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of legislation I \nhave introduced to protect ordinary American citizens from tax abuse at \nthe hands of our government. I was shocked when the United States \nSupreme Court ruled last month that governments could take private \nhomes, businesses and churches and turn them over to land developers in \nthe name of tax revenue.\n  My bill, the Eminent Domain Tax Relief Act, would prevent the \ngovernment from adding insult to this injury. It would eliminate the \ncapital gains tax that an individual has to pay on the money he \nreceives for his condemned property. Eminent domain abuse on its own is \nintolerable. But taxing those who lose their property is even more \ndeplorable. There is no excuse for making a person pay capital gains \ntax on something she did not want to sell in the first place.\n  Mr. Speaker, my legislation says this: No taxation on government \ncondemnation. I ask all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \njoin me in supporting this bill.\n",
