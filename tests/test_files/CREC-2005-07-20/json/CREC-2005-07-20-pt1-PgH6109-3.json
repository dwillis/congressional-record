We pray that the differences which divide us will \nbe mitigated and overcome by the common reverence that we share for \nYou. Indeed, we pray that our communion with You will inspire and \nenable us to build a national and an international community where Your \nfaith is reflected and recognized in the faces of all Your children, \nregardless of race, gender, religion, class, or sexual orientation. Let \nour communion with You enable us to build greater community with one \nanother.\n  On this day, make us Your servants indeed, and please allow our \nservice to You to find expression in the respect and reconciliation \nthat we seek to establish among all people.\n  It is in Your manifold, marvelous, and matchless name that we offer \nthis prayer. Amen.\n",
