Mr. Speaker, my colleague just before me \nindicated the crisis that we have in America where a young man is sent \noff four times to Iraq and not able to see his family.\n  Well, maybe the young soldier that I buried the other day, Nathaniel \nParker, who got liver disease in Iraq and died languishing in one of \nour military hospitals, or maybe the tragedy of 70 who died after a \nsuicide explosion there are crises that we should be focusing on. Then, \nof course, our friends on the other side of the aisle want to insist \nthat Americans change their basic infrastructure pension, that is, \nSocial Security. We know that whatever plan they have is going to cut \nAmerica's benefits. In fact, middle-class Americans will have their \nbenefits cut 40 percent.\n  Social Security should not be privatized. It can be fixed. It can be \nextended. Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill did it in 1983.\n  Women most of all will be hurt. More than 24 million women receive \nSocial\n\n\nSecurity. So I say to my colleagues here in the House, the Democrats \nrealize that a faulty plan is no plan on Social Security. A faulty plan \non the war is no plan. Let us get together and solve America's \nproblems.\n",
