This will be the first vote of the day. It is the \nmajority leader's hope and expectation that cloture will be invoked on \nthe nomination and the Senate can then expedite the vote on \nconfirmation.\n  Following the disposition of the Dorr nomination, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the Department of Defense authorization bill. \nChairman Warner and Senator Levin have been on the Senate floor this \nafternoon and have made real progress in disposing of a number of \namendments. We anticipate a full day of debate and voting on amendments \nto the Defense bill. I encourage Senators to contact the bill managers \nif they have amendments they wish to have considered.\n",
