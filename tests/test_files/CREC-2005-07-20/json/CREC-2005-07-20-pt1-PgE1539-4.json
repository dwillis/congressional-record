      "text": "  Mr. MANZULLO. Madam Speaker, I wish to express my strong support for \nH.R. 739, the Occupational Safety and Health Small Business Day in \nCourt Act; H.R. 740, the Occupational Safety and Health Review \nCommission Efficiency Act; H.R. 741, the Occupational Safety and Health \nIndependent Review of OSHA Citations Act; and H.R. 742, the \nOccupational Safety and Health Small Employer Access to Justice Act. As \nChairman of the Small Business Committee, I see daily the immense \nregulatory burden placed upon our small businesses. The Office of \nAdvocacy at the Small Business Administration (SBA) estimates that the \naverage small business is burdened with almost $7,000 per employee in \nregulatory compliance costs. I am pleased that the House has taken \naction to relieve small businesses of some of this burden.\n  H.R. 739 provides small businesses with additional flexibility by \nallowing certain exceptions to the arbitrary 15-day deadline for \nemployers to file responses to citations by the Occupational Safety and \nHealth Administration (OSHA). This commonsense measure allows an \nextension of the 15-day deadline in narrowly tailored circumstances, \nnamely when a small business inadvertently misses this deadline by \nmistake. H.R. 739 helps ensure that disputes between OSHA and small \nbusinesses would be resolved based on the merits of the situation as \nopposed to legal technicalities. No small business should be foreclosed \nfrom a remedy simply because of an arbitrary deadline.\n  H.R. 740 helps ensure that OSHA reviews cases in a timely and more \nefficient manner by adding two additional commissioners to the \nOccupational Safety and Health Review Commission (OSHRC). This change \nensures that small businesses do not have long, drawn-out proceedings \nthat monopolize their limited resources.\n  H.R. 741 is designed to restore the review process that was \noriginally intended by Congress when it enacted the OSHA law. \nCongress's original intent was to form a separate, independent, and \nunbiased entity, OSHRC, that presided over OSHA hearings. However, the \nlines between OSHA and OSHRC have become blurred. This bill restores \nthe original system contemplated by Congress and ensures that OSHRC, \nand not OSHA, would be the party who interprets the law and provides an \nindependent review of OSHA citations.\n  Finally, H.R. 742 will assist small businesses by giving these \nbusinesses an opportunity to recover attorney fees if successful in \nchallenging an OSHA citation.\n  In all, this common-sense legislation allows OSHA to continue \nprotecting workers at their place of employment, while giving small \nbusinesses the ability to be competitive, create jobs, and to be \nprotected from frivolous lawsuits.\n",
