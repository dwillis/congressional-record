      "text": "  Mr. CARDOZA. Mr. Speaker, the authors of the Congressional Republican \nSocial Security privatization plan are not being straight with the \nAmerican people. The Republicans claim that the plan that they \nintroduced last month includes a lockbox that prevents the use of \nSocial Security funds for other programs. This could not be further \nfrom the truth.\n  Under their privatization plan, Social Security's surplus cash would \ncontinue to go to the government, which would continue to spend it. \nInstead of a Social Security trust fund, account holders get Treasury \nbonds.\n  Even the bill's Republican author, the Social Security Subcommittee \nchairman, has acknowledged that under their bill the cash can still be \nused in the way it is now.\n  Over the last 4 years, the Republicans have raided $670 billion from \nthe Social Security trust fund to help pay for tax breaks. Despite \ntheir rhetoric now, the new Republican Social Security privatization \nscheme proves that they are up to their old tricks.\n  As we prepare for the 70th anniversary of Social Security next month, \nthe American people deserve a plan that strengthens Social Security for \nfuture generations and stops the raid on the Social Security trust \nfund.\n",
