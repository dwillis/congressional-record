This is from Congressional Quarterly. It is so \nbizarre I couldn't make it up. The House version of the Republican \nSocial Security surplus bill uses the Social Security surplus twice. \nFirst the government would borrow the surplus from Social Security's \ntrust funds in exchange for special Treasury bonds, as it does now. And \nit would then direct the surplus back into individual accounts, but \nthen borrow it back again in exchange for bonds that were put into \npeople's private accounts.\n  The debt on the individual's accounts would appear in the \ngovernment's budget. The debt to Social Security trust funds would \nremain off budget, as it is now. The surplus itself would be spent as \npart of the regular budget.\n  This is progress in the integrity of Social Security? This is some \ntotally bizarre joke that is so confusing that they are hoping that \nthey can snooker people into voting for it at 3 or 4 or 5 in the \nmorning like they did the Medicare bill, which is now $800 million over \nbudget and providing precious little\n\n\nhelp to our seniors who need prescription drugs. Do not be fooled \ntwice.\n",
