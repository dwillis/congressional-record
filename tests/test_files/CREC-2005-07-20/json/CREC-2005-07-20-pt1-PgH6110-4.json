It is the top 10 reasons the \neconomy is strong.\n  The late Alex Haley used to say, find the good and praise it. Mr. \nSpeaker, this morning I would like to pause and praise the free \nenterprise system and the wonderful men and women, the small business \nowners who have put their energy into building a strong economy. It is \ntheir work. They create the jobs, not us. It is government's job to \ncreate the environment and get out of the way and let free enterprise \ndo what it does best.\n  The items, the 10 items on this list are so encouraging. \nUnemployment, near historic lows, 5 percent; 4.4 percent average GDP \ngrowth since June of last year; 3.7 percent growth in manufacturing \noutput since June of last year.\n  The economy is strong. Free enterprise is doing its job. Mr. Speaker, \nlet us celebrate that success.\n",
