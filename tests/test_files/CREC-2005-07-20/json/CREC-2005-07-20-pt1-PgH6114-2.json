      "text": "  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, the rhetoric we are hearing from \nthe other side on Social Security and CAFTA is unbelievable. It is \nunbelievable because it is not factual. What we are proposing to do \nwith Social Security is to stop the raid of the Social Security surplus \nand give that money to the worker to go toward their Social Security \nretirement benefit. If it does not stop the raid, then how come the \nCBO, the Congressional Budget Office, tells us that the deficit goes up \nby an equal amount? How can they tell us, Congress, you are either \ngoing to have to raise taxes, cut spending or borrow somewhere else \nbecause they will not get the Social Security benefit because it is \ngoing to workers?\n  On CAFTA, it is a one-way trade agreement we have today. This makes \nit two-way. They already have free access to the American markets. We \ndo not have equal access to their markets. They already have lower \nstandards on worker rights, on environment. This raises those \nstandards. If we do not pass CAFTA, they get a free deal. We get no \ndeal. They have low labor rights. If we do pass CAFTA, we not only \nimprove their labor conditions, we improve the enforcement of their \nlabor rights and we give the American worker and the American economy a \nfair trade deal like we are now giving them.\n",
