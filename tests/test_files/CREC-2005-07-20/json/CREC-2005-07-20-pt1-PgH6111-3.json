Venezuela's Mussolini, Hugo Chavez, ordered 40 Russian \nmilitary helicopters to station on his border with Colombia. And he is \nalso taking delivery of over 100,000 AK-103 assault rifles to fight a \nnew war.\n  His war may be in Central America. His agents are already funneling \noil money to groups hostile to the United States and to free trade.\n  We in the Congress have a choice to make. We can either send exports \nto Central America or troops. Next week let us enact a free trade \nagreement with Central America to lock in democratic growth and \nstability, and let us make sure that President Hugo Chavez's Venezuelan \nagents find no fertile ground in America's back yard.\n",
