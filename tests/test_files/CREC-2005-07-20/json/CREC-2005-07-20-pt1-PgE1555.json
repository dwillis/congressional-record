      "text": "  Mr. KENNEDY of Rhode Island. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this \nopportunity to congratulate the Special Olympics on the celebration of \ntheir 37th anniversary. When the Special Olympics was founded in 1968, \nindividuals with developmental disabilities were all too often \nseparated from their families, as well as segregated from their \ncommunities. My aunt, Eunice Shriver, was able to see the potential of \nindividuals with intellectual disabilities through her sister, and my \nAunt, Rosemary. She was confident in her, and other disabled \nindividuals', ability to participate in a meaningful way in their \ncommunities. By using sport as a vehicle and stage for demonstrating \nthe dignity and capability of people with intellectual disabilities, \nMrs. Shriver recognized the impact not only on the athletes themselves, \nbut on the nation, as well. When the first International Special \nOlympic Games were held in 1968, 1,000 athletes participated from 26 \nstates and Canada. Today, the Special Olympics serves more than 1.73 \nmillion athletes in 150 countries around the world.\n  The Special Olympics goes far beyond serving the athletic needs of \ntheir participants, and has recently developed an initiative to provide \nmuch needed medical health services titled ``Healthy Athletes.'' \nSpecial Olympics ``Healthy Athletes'' improves access and health care \nfor athletes at event-based health screenings, as well as makes \nreferrals to local health practitioners when necessary. The data \ncollected during these screenings also provides valuable information on \nthe specific health needs of individuals with intellectual \ndisabilities. In fact, data from the 2003 Summer games showed that 30 \npercent of all athletes reported never having an eye exam and also \nreferred 23 percent of athletes for follow-up by a physical therapist.\n  The benefit of the Special Olympics to athletes, families, \nvolunteers, and coaches cannot be adequately measured by statistics and \nnumbers, but can be best represented by the recognition of the \npotential of individuals with intellectual disabilities by our society. \nCongratulations to the Special Olympics on 37 years of extraordinary \nservice.\n",
