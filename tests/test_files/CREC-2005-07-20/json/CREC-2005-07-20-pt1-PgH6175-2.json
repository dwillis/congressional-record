That is to honor \nJim Stockdale.\n  Admiral Stockdale is a true American hero. He died on July 5. He was \na prisoner of war for 5\\1/2\\ years. He was so brutally beaten his \nshoulders were ripped out of their sockets. He was beaten by the \nVietnamese so bad, almost senseless, that Jeremiah Denton had to take \nover his leadership of the camp at the Hanoi Hilton and of all POWs.\n  He was then moved in with our Congressman Sam Johnson just to \nrecover. It took him almost a year to do that. Admiral Stockdale and \nhis wife, Sybil, who support our MIAs and our POWs we honor here in \nthis body.\n",
