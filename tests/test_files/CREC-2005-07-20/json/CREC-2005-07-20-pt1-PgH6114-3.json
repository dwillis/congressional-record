Mr. Speaker, after 9/11, my fellow lawmakers wanted to \nmake sure that the PATRIOT Act would protect Americans without \ntrampling the civil rights that we cherish in this Nation. Mr. Speaker, \ntoday, 4 years later, the verdict is in. The PATRIOT Act works and is \nhelping defeat terrorism. Those of us who thought the threat of \nterrorism receded can only look at Great Britain to know that this is \nnot the case. Complacency allows waves of terror to come crashing over \nfree nations. The attacks on London show that the war on terror is not \nover nor is it confined to a specific location. Securing our homeland \nis only one facet of the war. Spreading democracy in the savage lands \nwhere terrorism propagates is another.\n  The PATRIOT Act gives us enforcement tools that keep America safe. \nThe PATRIOT Act has removed major legal barriers that prevented law \nenforcement agencies from coordinating their work. It has also allowed \nlaw enforcement to use surveillance against terror-related activities \nand allowed the issuance of nationwide search warrants. The PATRIOT Act \nis doing exactly what it is supposed to do. We cannot allow these \nterrorists to gain momentum in this fight.\n",
