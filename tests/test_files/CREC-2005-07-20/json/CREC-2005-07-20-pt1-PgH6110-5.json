Mr. Speaker, I rise today because \nI just cannot help feeling remorse for what has happened to the truth \nin America.\n  For more than a week, the American people have known that Karl Rove \nwas involved in the leaking of a covert CIA agent's name to the press. \nHe damaged our national security and put an agent at risk. This is not \nthe work of a patriot.\n  Of course, Rove did not admit to his treachery. Instead, the story \nhas come out through reporters who are getting their information from \nKarl Rove's attorney.\n  Republicans, from the President on down, continue to say that they \nwill not comment until they know all the facts. Here is an idea: \nPresident Bush should demand that Karl Rove come clean and tell the \nAmerican people everything.\n\n\n  While Rove continues to hide behind his attorney, a grand jury is \ninvestigating the matter. For some strange reason, Republicans claim \nthat Rove has been vindicated. Something tells me that if Rove really \nbelieved he was innocent of wrongdoing, we would have already heard \nfrom him by now.\n\n\n  The silence from both Rove and the White House is deafening, while \nthe truth continues to be obscured for political gain.\n",
