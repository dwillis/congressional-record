      "text": "  Ms. McCOLLUM of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition \nto H.R. 739, H.R. 740, H.R. 741, and H.R. 742.\n  Today, America's workers need the protections provided under the \nOccupational Safety and Health Act more than ever. Each year, 6,000 \nworkers die in workplace-related accidents, and 50,000-60,000 people \ndie from illnesses caused by their jobs. The protections in OSHA ensure \nwhat our Nation's workforce has fought for and deserves--a safe and \nhealthy workplace.\n  Instead of strengthening these worker protections, the bills before \nus today are an attack on the very intent of these important \nsafeguards.\n  The first bill, H.R. 739, excuses employers that fail to respond to \nOSHA citations within the 15-day deadline. The Occupational Safety and \nHealth Review Commission (OSHRC) already has the authority to review \nmissed deadlines on a case-by-case basis. This change removes the \nincentive for employers to quickly respond to hazards. Meanwhile, the \nsafety and health of workers hang in the balance.\n  H.R. 740 seeks to expand OSHRC to five members and require that all \nmembers be lawyers. Since the Comnission was established in 1970, it \nhas been composed of three members and has benefited from the expertise \nof those not holding law degrees. This change inaccurately reflects the \nworkload and responsibilities of OSHRC and unfairly excludes the \ncontributions of members with strong backgrounds in safety and health.\n  H.R. 741 transfers the authority to bring cases to the Court of \nAppeals and the Supreme Court from the Secretary of Labor to OSHRC. \nThis modification overturns a 1991 Supreme Court decision and \nundermines the Secretary's responsibility to enforce OSHA policies.\n  The biggest blow delivered by H.R. 742 requires OSHA to pay \nattorney's fees for every case it does not win, regardless of why the \ncase lost or how well-justified it was. This places the burden of these \ncases squarely on the taxpayer and leaves America's workforce more \nvulnerable than ever.\n  The substitute amendment offered by Congressman George Miller to \nraise the minimum wage has my full support. It is unacceptable that \nemployees working 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, for minimum wage \nearn only $10,700 a year--$3,400 below the poverty line for a family of \nthree. American full-time, full-year workers should not be forced to \nraise their families in poverty. It is unfortunate that this amendment \nwas not made in order by the Republican leadership, as this raise would \nhave benefited over 11 million American workers and their families.\n  The hard-working men and women of this country deserve to be \nprotected and safe in the workplace, Mr. Speaker. That is why I urge my \ncolleagues to vote against these ill-conceived bills.\n",
