      "text": "  Mr. ETHERIDGE. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to express my opposition to \nthe recent Republican proposals to privatize Social Security.\n  Privatizing Social Security is like tearing down the barn to fix the \nroof. It adds trillions of dollars to the national debt and does \nnothing to fix the long-term challenges facing Social Security.\n  The Republican privatization proposal hands future generations a \ntriple burden: a reduction in guaranteed benefits, a hefty transition \ncost, and a Social Security system that is no closer to solvency.\n  This is a classic bait-and-switch maneuver, and American workers will \nnot be fooled by trickery, political schemes to line the pockets of \nWall Street bankers with their retirement savings.\n  This country has made a commitment to seniors and to current workers \nalike that Social Security will be available upon retirement. We cannot \ngo back on our word. Rural America in particular is counting on Social \nSecurity to be there when they need it.\n  As we prepare to celebrate the 70th anniversary of Social Security, I \nurge the President to take privatization off the table so that we might \nachieve a bipartisan agreement to strengthen Social Security for the \nlong term and enhance the retirement security for all Americans.\n",
