Mr. Speaker, I want to acknowledge the contributions of \na very special church in Louisiana's 7th Congressional District.\n  The Pleasant Green Baptist Church has been an important part of the \nSulphur community and on July 31, 2005, Pleasant Green will be \ncelebrating its 100th anniversary.\n  The church's current leader, Rev. James Gatewood, is a dedicated \nservant. His success and the church's strong presence are directly \nattributable to the faith, generosity, and contributions of the \ncongregation. The church\n\n\nhas been an important part of the moral fabric of Southwest Louisiana \nfor 100 years and I am confident Pleasant Green Baptist Church will \ncontinue to be a valuable community member for many years to come.\n  Today I want to recognize and congratulate the church and its \ncongregation, for reaching this historic milestone.\n",
