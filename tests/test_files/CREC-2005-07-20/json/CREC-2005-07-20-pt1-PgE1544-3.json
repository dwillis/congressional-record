Mr. Speaker, I rise today to \ncongratulate Mr. Benjamin Mendoza, Sr., owner of Kelly's Body Shop in \nSanta Ana, California.\n  Kelly's Body Shop was opened in 1978 by three separate owners but was \nthen bought in 1994 by Mr. Mendoza who consolidated its ownership.\n  Over the past 12 years, under Mr. Mendoza's ownership and strong \nmanagement skills, Kelly's Body Shop has become one of the most \nsuccessful businesses in Santa Ana, almost tripling its production and \nrevenue in 2001.\n  Mr. Mendoza considers it the mission of Kelly's Body Shop to provide \nquality, timely and satisfactory repairs and services to all of its \ncustomers and the people of Santa Ana, California.\n  It is for these reasons that on June 15, 2005, the California Small \nBusiness Association awarded Mr. Mendoza a Small Business Award for his \ncontribution and dedication to the city and people of Santa Ana.\n  Kelly's Body Shop is an example of a successful business in \nCalifornia that continues to give back to its community. I believe that \nMr. Benjamin Mendoza, Sr., will continue to expand his commitment to \nthe communities he serves.\n",
