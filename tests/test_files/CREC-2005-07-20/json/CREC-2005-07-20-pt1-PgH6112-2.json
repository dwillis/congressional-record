Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak \nabout Social Security and the millions of American women who rely on it \nevery day.\n  Women are among one of the largest groups of Social Security \nbeneficiaries who stand to lose a great deal should Social Security be \nprivatized. On average, women live 3 years longer than men. Any \ncontributions to a private account would have to stretch out over more \nyears.\n  Additionally, the private accounts do not have the guaranteed annual \ncost-of-living increase in Social Security which would jeopardize the \nretirement and economic security of older women through the gamble of \nthe stock market.\n  Social Security is a good deal for women because it gives people with \nlower earnings a greater return on what they paid in, and women on \naverage have lower incomes and less time in the workforce.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is high time we quit talking about privatizing Social \nSecurity and instead come up with ways to strengthen it.\n",
