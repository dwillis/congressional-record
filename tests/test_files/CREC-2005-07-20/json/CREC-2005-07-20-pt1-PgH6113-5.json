While CAFTA countries also enjoy duty-free access to U.S. \nmarkets for the majority of their products through U.S. trade \npreference programs, these countries often have high tariff and \nnontariff barriers for U.S. exports.\n  Under CAFTA, barriers to U.S. exports in these countries would be \ndrastically reduced. More than 80 percent of U.S. consumer and \nindustrial exports and over half of U.S. farm exports to Central \nAmerica would become duty-free immediately with the agreement's \nenactment, and the rest would be phased out over time. CAFTA would also \nbenefit the State of Georgia, which I represent, by providing new \nmarket access for our State's products.\n  CAFTA will also help the U.S. and CAFTA countries compete with China, \na growing economic force in the world market. Seventy-one percent of \napparel from CAFTA countries currently enters the United States using \nU.S. yarns and fabrics, while only one-tenth of 1 percent of apparel \nfrom China enters the United States using U.S. yarn or fabric.\n  Mr. Speaker, this body must pass CAFTA and give the United States the \nsame access to the markets in South America that they have to ours.\n",
